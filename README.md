# SNHU305-Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial is a bank that wanted a secure code base that would keep the system and users safe. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    I was able to understand the vulnerabilities found using the maven dependency checker well. I was also able to eliminate the false positives that the report would show. I learned that coding securely is important because an attack will come at every input and keystroke and this has to be prevented. Secure coding keeps the business from accidental leaks and data breaches. This will help keep the trust level high which will help keep customers and should help get new customers. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    The hard part of working through the vulnerability assessment was the amount of detail that must be kept. This was a very small project and still took hours of reading line by line trying to ensure that everything was covered. 
    
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    I was all over the place when I first started. I was trying to run the OWASP and check for errors. However, I learned that this is just like anything else. Start with manual review of the code. Then move to the OWASP checker. This really helped everything fall into place. 
    
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    Start by checking for errors. Then moving to checking user input limits. Then check dependencies. After Code was changed I would run the program and see if there were any errors or warnings. If there where I would refactor the code again until there were no problems.
    
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    The biggest practice that I learned from this class is to research what you might want to use first and see what the vulnerabilities are before starting. This can save a lot of time by starting on the right track instead of wasting time building something that will never work. 
    
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
    I decided to share the first project. I feel that it is good to share because of how robust it is. It started by interpreting the client's needs. Looking at secure communications and international transactions. This is something that I have never done before. After looking at the client's needs, come up with a plan to make sure those areas are security. Next was to manual review the code and see what needed to be changed so that there was not a simple mistake that could be exploited. Then there was a static test that was interesting to see. So many simple errors that could be fixed just by updating the librarys. I know that can be time consuming but I had no idea how important that step really was. Last was to come up with a plan that would help fix all of the weak spots that I found.
